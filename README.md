# Elm Guide

This is my workbook for the [Elm Guide][], you can run the examples with the reactor, I've added some make commands for convenience. Check out the `Makefile` for more information.

```bash
# Install the dependencies (local to this directory)
make install

# Start an Elm repl
make repl

# Run the reactor
make reactor
```
